## Projects

**[Predict Sparkify User Churn](https://github.com/ustcdj/Sparkify_Churn_Analysis)**

**[Blog Link @Medium](https://medium.com/@ustcdj/sparkify-udacity-data-science-capstone-project-b273b4ab1c8d)**

Preventing churn is key to improving revenue for Sparkify, a subscription-based company (fictitious). This project is to analyze data from Sparkify to build a model to predict user churn. First, a sample dataset (128MB) was used on a local machine to explore relevant features and develop a working model. Then similar steps were used to develop a final working model for the full dataset(12GB) on the AWS cloud.

**[Recommendation Engine with IBM](https://github.com/ustcdj/Recommendation_Engine_with_IBM)**

This project is to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they might like. Recommending articles that are most pertinent to specific users is beneficial to both service providers and users.

Toolkit: Machine Learning (PCA, clustering, collaborative filtering), NLP, Python,

**[Classify Disaster Response](https://github.com/ustcdj/Disaster_Response)**

**[Web App Link](https://dj-disaster-response-webapp.herokuapp.com/)**

During disaster events, sending messages to appropriate disaster relief agencies on a timely manner is critical. Using natural language processing and machine learning, I built a model for an API that classifies disaster messages and also a webapp for emergency works.

Toolkit: Supervised Learning (classification), NLP, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**[Identify Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/ustcdj/Identify_Customer_Segmentation)**

The goal of this project is to help a mail-order sales company in Germany to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that should bring high expected returns.

Toolkit: Unsupervised Learning (classification), Python, Scikit-learn

**[Flower Image Classification](https://github.com/ustcdj/Image_Classification)**

This project uses pre-trained neuron network densenet121 and trains an image classifier to recognize 112 species of flowers with 89% accuracy.

Toolkit: Deep Learning, Python, PyTorch, GPU

**[Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/ustcdj/Finding_Donors)**

The goal of this project is to help a fictitious charity organization (CharityML) to develop a supervised learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000 annually. Understanding an individual's income can help this charity better understand which potential donors they should reach out and the amount of donation to request.
