### Projects

**[Predict Sparkify User Churn](https://github.com/ustcdj/Sparkify_Churn_Analysis)**

In this project I analyzed fake customer data from an ecommerce company and used linear regression to help them decide whether to focus their efforts on their website or their mobile app.  I used Python's Seaborn and Pandas packages to visualize the data and scikit-learn to create the linear regression.
