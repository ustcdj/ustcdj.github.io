## Projects

**[Forecast Monthly Vehicle Sales (Click me -->)](https://github.com/ustcdj/Forecast_Monthly_Vehicle_Sales)**

*Toolkit: Time series forecasting, Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels, sklearn*

Using time series forecasting, analyzed monthly vehicle sales in the United States between January 1976 and November 2019, found the overall trend over time and made
forecasts for vehicle sales in December 2019 and May 2020.

**[Predict Sparkify User Churn (Click me)](https://github.com/ustcdj/Sparkify_Churn_Analysis)**
> **[Blog Link](https://medium.com/@ustcdj/sparkify-udacity-data-science-capstone-project-b273b4ab1c8d)**

*Toolkit: Supervised learning (classification), Python, pyspark, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, AWS EMR*

Preventing churn is key to improving revenue for Sparkify, a fictitious subscription-based music streaming company. Using PySpark on AWS, I analyzed 12GB data from Sparkify and built a machine learning model to predict user churn with an F score of 0.56.

**[Recommendation Engine with IBM (CLICK ME)](https://github.com/ustcdj/Recommendation_Engine_with_IBM)**  

*Toolkit: Machine learning (collaborative filtering), Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib*

Recommending articles that are most pertinent to specific users is beneficial to both service providers and users. Using three mainstream approaches - (1) Rank Based, (2) User-User Based Collaborative Filtering, and (3) Matrix Factorization, I developed an article recommendation engine for the IBM Watson Studio platform.

**[Classify Disaster Response (click me)](https://github.com/ustcdj/Disaster_Response)**
> **[Web App Link](https://dj-disaster-response-webapp.herokuapp.com/)**

*Toolkit: Supervised learning (classification), Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, plotly, NLP, SQL, SQLAlchemy, HTML, Flask*

During disaster events, sending messages to appropriate disaster relief agencies on a timely manner is critical. Using NLP and machine learning pipeline, I built a model that classifies disaster messages into 36 categories with an F score of 0.65.
A webapp was also developed.

**[Airbnb List Price Analysis (clicke me!)](https://github.com/ustcdj/Airbnb_Pricing)**  
> **[Blog Link](https://medium.com/@ustcdj/wanna-make-more-money-on-airbnb-e7549453d5b0)**

*Toolkit: Supervised learning (regression), Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn*

I analyzed Airbnb list prices in Boston and Seattle to answer three questions:  
Q1 - Is there any trend in the Airbnb list price? How do prices compare between Boston and Seattle?  
Q2 - Should you become a super host?  
Q3 - What factors affect the Airbnb list price?

**[Identify Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/ustcdj/Identify_Customer_Segmentation)**

*Toolkit: Unsupervised learning (PCA, clustering), Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, searborn*

The goal of this project is to help a mail-order sales company in Germany to identify segments of the population that form its core customer base. I applied unsupervised learning techniques (PCA, clustering) on demographic and spending data of 0.89 million German households. Among them, two segments were identified and can be used for direct marketing campaigns that should bring the highest expected returns.

**[Flower Image Classification](https://github.com/ustcdj/Image_Classification)**

*Toolkit: Deep learning, Python, PyTorch, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, GPU*

Using a pre-trained deep learning model densenet121, I built an image classification application and used the trained model to recognize 112 species of flowers with 89% accuracy.

**[Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/ustcdj/Finding_Donors)**

*Toolkit: Supervised learning (classification), Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy*

Used supervised learning algorithms, I built a machine learning model for a fictitious charity organization (CharityML) that can predict potential charity donors (individual makes more than $50,000 annually) with 86% accuracy and an F-score of 0.73.
